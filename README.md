## Differentially private Shakespeare

Differentially private Shakespeare is a two part demo showing how one can
perform a differentially private query across someone elses data. The data
in the example is a summary of Shakespeares plays.

 1. Alice [uploads](upload-shakespeare-summary) the data,
 1. Bob performs a [differentially private](dp-shakespeare) query over the data.

 The repo also includes dataset handling scripts for
 [listing owned datasets](dataset-list) and [deleting test data](delete-data).
